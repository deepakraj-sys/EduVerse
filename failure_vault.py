The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, often nicknamed \"Galloping Gertie,\" became one of the most infamous examples of structural failure in engineering history when it dramatically collapsed on November 7, 1940, just four months after its opening. Located in the state of Washington, USA, this suspension bridge was designed to span the Tacoma Narrows strait of Puget Sound between the cities of Tacoma and the Kitsap Peninsula. It was the third-longest suspension bridge in the world at the time, following the Golden Gate and George Washington bridges, with a central span of 2,800 feet (853 meters). Despite its grand scale and importance, the bridge‚Äôs demise became a defining case study in the fields of aerodynamics, structural engineering, and resonance-induced vibration. ...",
